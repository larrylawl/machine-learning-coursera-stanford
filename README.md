## What is this?

My source code for the machine learning course offered by Andrew Ng. Concretely, I have implemented the following

**Week 2:** Linear Regression

**Week 3:** Logistic Regression

**Week 4:** Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

**Week 5:** Neural Networks Learning

**Week 6:** Regularised Linear Regression and Bias vs Variance

**Week 7:** Support Vector Machines

**Week 8:** K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

**Week 9:** Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

Separately, you can view my course notes [here,](https://larrylawl.github.io/notes/coursera-ml-notes.html) and my course certificate [here.](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/LH2G2LB4GT2A)

## Credits
This course marks my first step into the world of Machine Learning, and I'm thankful that this step has been so enriching. 

Thank you Professor Andrew Ng, and his volunteer teaching team (specifically Tom and Neil!), for democratising quality machine learning education.
